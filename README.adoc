This is a sample project that implements:

- https://vapor.codes/[Vapor 4.0]
- https://developer.apple.com/swift/[Swift 5.4]
- https://inertiajs.com/[InertiaJS]
- https://svelte.dev/[Svelte]
- https://laravel-mix.com/[Laravel Mix]
- https://github.com/vapor/leaf[Leaf Templates]

The Inertia Adapter was based on https://github.com/lloople/vapor-inertia-adapter
and heavily modified so it is properly working. Thats why is in _Deps_ directory.

This is just a sample implementation. May be a better approach is possible.
Please experiment and see if this works for your use case.

## webpack.mix.js

The _webpack.mix.js_ was modified in order to generate a _Sources/App/mix.swift_ file
that will contain the values of _mix-manifest.json_.

Modify _vapor.mix.js_ to your needs.

## Commands

- `make install`: Will install _npm_modules_ directory.
- `make webpack-watch`: Will run the _Laravel Mix_ watcher for any change inside the _Resources/js_ directory.
- `make run`: Will execute the Vapor Server.
